## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 1.5h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [installation](/modules/installation) module.
 * the [python data analysis](/modules/python_data_analysis) module (recommended for Python familiarity).
 * the [fmri connectivity](/modules/fmri_connectivity) module.

If you have any questions regarding the module content please ask them in the relevant module channel on the school Discord server. If you do not have access to the server and would like to join, please send us an email at school [dot] brainhack [at] gmail [dot] com.

## Resources
The first portion of this module was presented by Pierre Bellec during Brainhack School 2020 and the notebook was created by Desiree Lussier for this module.

The tutorial slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mTJoOSRKtGzhWeNLa9PXyKUYA0p9733UHVWrmIyi4zs/edit?usp=sharing) starting from Slide 39.

The video presentation is available here:

## Exercise

 * Watch the video presentation by Pierre Bellec and go over the slides.
 * Download the notebook created for this module found [here](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/blob/main/content/en/modules/fmri_parcellation/atlas_parcellations.ipynb).
 * Run the notebook to view the parcellation for the atlas example.
 * Create new code blocks in your notebook and the example to retrieve three other atlases using Nilearn datasets, the documentation for which you can find [here](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/datasets.html), and view the atlases in your notebook.
 * Answer the discussion at the bottom of the notebook in the markdown block provided and save.
 * Follow up with your local TA(s) to validate you completed the exercises correctly.
 * ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ you completed this training module! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
