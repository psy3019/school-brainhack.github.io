# Summarize your project in < ~75 words. This description will appear at the top of your page and on the list page with other projects..

summary: "In this module, you will learn how to package python modules using `pypi`. This will let you install some of your own code with `pip`, dealing cleanly with dependencies, as well as share publicly a package."

## Exercice

 * To run this exercise, you will need a small python module. You can create a toy python module by following this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm). It would be better to start creating one (or a couple of) module(s) for your project, so you work directly with a meaningful code base.
 * Add your module to a new git repository under your personal account. This is not necessary, but putting code on git control should be second nature at this stage :) Note that the module will read in a folder inside the repository. The top level directory is for configuration files for the project, not the code itself.
 * Create and populate a `README.md` file
 * Create and populate a `license.txt` file
 * Fill a `requirements.txt` file. Include everything needed for development, including e.g. `jupyter-notebook` and `pytest`.
 * Fill a `pyproject.toml` file. Start from a [template](https://martin-thoma.com/pyproject-toml/). These two last steps are much more meaningful if you are working with a code base for your project, rather than a toy module with no dependencies.
 * Configure the meta-data of your project with `setup.cfg`. Check the [documentation of pypi](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#configuring-metadata) for more info.
 * Add on `__init.py__` in your module folder. See this [example](https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-init-py/)
 * Try installing your package locally by running `pip install -e .` in your repository.
 * **Optional**: You can try to create the distribution files and publish this package on a test server of `pypi`. This step is described in this [tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives). The pypi test server is made to test how publishing a package works - so don't worry if this is just a test or if you make mistakes, the server exists for that purpose. If you upload the package on pipy itself, anybody will be able to install your software by typing `pip install <my_package>` but beware! `pipy` is a community resource, and you should only publish serious, well tested projects on there.
 * Follow up with your local TA(s) to validate you completed the exercises correctly.
