## Resources

The main resource for this module is the 2023 Spinal Cord Toolbox Course given by Prof. Julien Cohen-Adad and his team at [NeuroPoly lab](https://neuro.polymtl.ca).

The workshop is available on YouTube:

For the purpose of this module, we will focus on the following chapters of the workshop:

 * 18:39 `2. Installation`
 * 31:37 `3. Segmentation`
 * 47:35 `4. Vertebral labeling`
 * 1:07:30 `5. Shape-based analysis`
 * 1:31:03 `6. Registration to template` (only up to 1:48:00)

The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t40Fd0fS0SwWR5FU_GWKEvHkB9d96LVddLQW6L3QAx0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Exercise

 * Watch the selected chapters of the Spinal Cord Toolbox Course.
 * Install the Spinal Cord Toolbox on your local machine.
 * Download the sample data as described in the `2. Installation` chapter.
 * Do the segmentation of the spinal cord using two methods (e.g., `sct_deepseg_sc`, `sct_propseg`, `sct_deepseg`) and compare the results. TIP: to visualize the results, you can use viewer of your choice (e.g., `fsleyes`, `itk-snap`) or python (`nibabel` and `matplotlib`).
 * Perform the vertebral labeling.
 * Compute cross-sectional area (CSA) of the spinal cord at the C2-C3 levels.
 * Do the registration of the T2w image to the template.
 * Follow up with your local TA to validate you completed the exercises correctly.
